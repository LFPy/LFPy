LFPy documentation
==================

.. image:: logo_liten.png

LFPy is a Python package for simulation of extracellular electric field around neurons. It relies on the 
`NEURON simulator <http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/>`_ and the 
`Python interface to NEURON <http://www.frontiersin.org/neuroinformatics/10.3389/neuro.11.001.2009/abstract>`_.

LFPy was developed at the `Computational Neuroscience Group <http://compneuro.umb.no>`_ at the `Norwegian University of Life Sciences <www.umb.no>`_, in collaboration with the 
`Laboratory of Neuroinformatics <http://www.nencki.gov.pl/en/laboratory-of-neuroinformatics>`_, 
`Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology <http://www.nencki.gov.pl>`_, Warsaw, Poland. The effort was supported by 
`International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility <http://incf.org>`_ (`INCF <http://incf.org>`_) and the e-science program of `The Research Council of Norway <http://www.forskningsradet.no/english/>`_.
