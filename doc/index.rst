Welcome to LFPy's documentation!
================================

(Looking for the old LFPy v1.* documentation? Follow `link <https://lfpy.github.io/v1.3>`_)

LFPy is a `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ package for calculation of extracellular potentials from multicompartment neuron models and recurrent networks of multicompartment neurons.
It relies on the `NEURON simulator <http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/>`_ and uses the
`Python interface <http://www.frontiersin.org/neuroinformatics/10.3389/neuro.11.001.2009/abstract>`_ it provides.

Active development of LFPy, as well as issue tracking and revision tracking, relies on `GitHub.com <https://github.com/LFPy/LFPy>`_ and `git (git-scm.com) <https://git-scm.com>`_.
Clone LFPy on `GitHub.com <https://github.com/LFPy/LFPy>`_: ``git clone https://github.com/LFPy/LFPy.git``

LFPy provides a set of easy-to-use Python classes for setting up your model, running your simulations and calculating the extracellular potentials arising from activity in your model neuron. If you have a model
working in `NEURON <http://www.neuron.yale.edu>`_ or `NeuroML2 <https://www.neuroml.org/neuromlv2>`_
already, it is likely that it can be adapted to work with LFPy.

The extracellular potentials are calculated from transmembrane currents in multi-compartment neuron models using the line-source method (Holt & Koch, J Comp Neurosci 1999),
but a simpler point-source method is also available. The calculations assume that the neuron are surrounded by an infinite extracellular medium with homogeneous and
frequency independent conductivity, and compartments are assumed to be at least at a minimal distance from the electrode (which can be specified by the user).
For more information on the biophysics underlying the numerical framework used see this coming book chapter:

- K.H. Pettersen, H. Linden, A.M. Dale and G.T. Einevoll: Extracellular spikes and current-source density, in *Handbook of Neural Activity Measurement*,
  edited by R. Brette and A. Destexhe, Cambridge, to appear `[preprint PDF, 5.7MB] <http://www.csc.kth.se/~helinden/PettersenLindenDaleEinevoll-BookChapter-revised.pdf>`_

In previous versions (v1.x.x), LFPy was mainly designed for simulation of single neurons,
but the forward modeling scheme is in general applicable to neuronal populations.
These aspects, and the biophysical assumptions behind LFPy is described in our paper on the package appearing in Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, entitled `"LFPy: A tool for biophysical simulation of extracellular potentials generated by detailed model neurons" <http://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffninf.2013.00041>`_,
appearing as part of the research topic `"Python in Neuroscience II" <http://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/researchtopics/Python_in_Neuroscience_II/1591/>`_.

Since v2, LFPy also supports networks of multicompartment neurons, calculations of current-dipole moments, and predictions of both electric potentials and magnetic signals from a series of different volume-conductor models, as described in
the bioRXiv preprint "Multimodal modeling of neural network activity: computing LFP, ECoG, EEG and MEG signals with LFPy2.0" by Espen Hagen, Solveig Næss, Torbjørn V Ness, Gaute T Einevoll, found at `https://doi.org/10.1101/281717 <https://doi.org/10.1101/281717>`_.
