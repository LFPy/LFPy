LFPy  
====

Summary
-------

LFPy is a Python module for calculation of extracellular potentials from multicompartment neuron models.
It relies on the NEURON simulator (http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron) and uses the
Python interface (http://www.frontiersin.org/neuroinformatics/10.3389/neuro.11.001.2009/abstract) it provides.

Usage
-----
A basic simulation of extracellular potentials of a multicompartment neuron model set up with LFPy:

    >>> # import modules
    >>> import LFPy
    >>> from LFPy import Cell, Synapse, LineSourcePotential
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> # create Cell
    >>> cell = Cell(morphology=''.join(LFPy.__path__ +
    >>>                                ['/test/ball_and_sticks.hoc']),
    >>>             passive=True,  # NEURON 'pas' mechanism
    >>>             tstop=100,  # ms
    >>>            )
    >>> # create Synapse
    >>> synapse = Synapse(cell=cell,
    >>>                   idx=cell.get_idx("soma[0]"),  # soma segment index
    >>>                   syntype='Exp2Syn',  # two-exponential synapse
    >>>                   weight=0.005,  # max conductance (uS)
    >>>                   e=0,  # reversal potential (mV)
    >>>                   tau1=0.5,  # rise time constant
    >>>                   tau2=5.,  # decay time constant
    >>>                   record_current=True,  # record synapse current
    >>>                  )
    >>> synapse.set_spike_times(np.array([20., 40]))  # set activation times
    >>> # create extracellular predictor
    >>> lsp = LineSourcePotential(cell=cell,
    >>>                           x=np.zeros(11) + 10,  # x-coordinates of contacts (µm)

    >>>                           z=np.arange(11)*20,  # z-coordinates
    >>>                           sigma=0.3,  # extracellular conductivity (S/m)
    >>>                          )
    >>> # execute simulation
    >>> cell.simulate(probes=[lsp])  # compute measurements at run time

Information
-----------

LFPy provides a set of easy-to-use Python classes for setting up your model, running your simulations and calculating the extracellular potentials arising from activity in your model neuron. If you have a model working in NEURON (www.neuron.yale.edu) already, it is likely that it can be adapted to work with LFPy.

The extracellular potentials are calculated from transmembrane currents in multi-compartment neuron models using the line-source method (Holt & Koch, J Comp Neurosci 1999),
but a simpler point-source method is also available. The calculations assume that the neuron are surrounded by an infinite extracellular medium with homogeneous and frequency
independent conductivity, and compartments are assumed to be at least at a minimal distance from the electrode (which can be specified by the user). For more information on
the biophysics underlying the numerical framework used see this coming book chapter:

- K.H. Pettersen, H. Linden, A.M. Dale and G.T. Einevoll: Extracellular spikes and current-source density, in *Handbook of Neural Activity Measurement*, edited by R. Brette and A. Destexhe, Cambridge, to appear (preprint PDF, 5.7MB http://www.csc.kth.se/~helinden/PettersenLindenDaleEinevoll-BookChapter-revised.pdf

The first release of LFPy (v1.x) was mainly designed for simulation extracellular potentials of single neurons, described in our paper on the package in Frontiers in Neuroinformatics entitled "LFPy: A tool for biophysical simulation of extracellular potentials generated by detailed model neurons".
The article can be found at https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2013.00041.
Since version 2 (LFPy v2.x), the tool also facilitates simulations of extracellular potentials and current dipole moment from ongoing activity in recurrently connected networks of multicompartment neurons, prediction of EEG scalp surface potentials,
MEG scalp surface magnetic fields, as described in the publication "Multimodal modeling of neural network activity: computing LFP, ECoG, EEG and MEG signals with LFPy2.0" by Espen Hagen, Solveig Naess, Torbjoern V Ness, Gaute T Einevoll, found at https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2018.00092.

Requirements
------------

Dependencies should normally be automatically installed.
For manual preinstallation of dependencies, the following packages are needed:

-  Python modules numpy, scipy, matplotlib, h5py, mpi4py
-  MEAutility (https://github.com/alejoe91/MEAutility)
-  LFPykit (https://github.com/LFPy/LFPykit)
-  NEURON (from http://www.neuron.yale.edu, v7.6.4 or newer) and corresponding Python module. The following should execute without error in a Python console:

        >>> import neuron
        >>> neuron.test()

-  Cython (C-extensions for python, http://cython.org) to speed up simulations of extracellular fields


Installation
------------

There are few options to install LFPy:

1.  From the Python Package Index with only local access using pip:

        $ pip install LFPy --user

    as sudoer (in general not recommended as system Python files may be overwritten):

        $ sudo pip install LFPy

    Upgrading LFPy from the Python package index (without attempts at upgrading dependencies):

        $ pip install --upgrade --no-deps LFPy --user

    LFPy release candidates can be installed as:

        $ pip install --pre --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple LFPy --user

2.  From the Python Package Index with only local access using easy_install:

        $ easy_install --user LFPy

    As sudoer:

        $ sudo easy_install LFPy

3.  From source:

        $ tar -xzf LFPy-x.x.tar.gz

        $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
        $ conda config --set channel_priority strict  # suggested

    Create a new conda environment with LFPy and activate it:

        $ conda create -n lfpy python=3 pip lfpy  # creates new Python 3.x conda environment named lfpy with pip and LFPy and their dependencies
        $ conda activate lfpy  # activate the lfpy environment
        $ python -c "import LFPy; LFPy.run_tests()"  # check that installation is working

    LFPy can also be installed in existing conda environments if the dependency tree is solvable:

        $ conda activate <environment>
        $ conda install lfpy  # installs LFPy and its dependencies in the current conda environment


Uninstall
---------

To remove installed LFPy files it should suffice to issue (repeat until no more LFPy files are found):

    $ (sudo) pip uninstall LFPy

In case LFPy was installed using conda in an environment, it can be uninstalled by issuing:

    $ conda uninstall lfpy


Docker
------

We provide a Docker (https://www.docker.com, https://hub.docker.com/r/lfpy/lfpy) container build file with LFPy.
To get started, install Docker and issue either:

    # pull from docker hub
    $ docker pull lfpy/lfpy
    $ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 lfpy/lfpy


or

    # build Dockerfile from GitHub
    $ docker build -t lfpy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LFPy/LFPy/master/Dockerfile
    $ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 lfpy:latest


or

    # build local Dockerfile (obtained by cloning repo, checkout branch etc.)
    $ docker build -t lfpy - < Dockerfile
    $ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 lfpy:latest


The ``--mount`` option can be used to mount a folder on the host to a target folder as:

    $ docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/opt -it -p 5000:5000 lfpy


which mounts the present working dirctory (``$(pwd)``) to the ``/opt`` directory of the container.
Try mounting the ``LFPy`` source directory for example (by setting ``source="<path-to-LFPy>"``).
Various LFPy example files can then be found in the folder ``/opt/LFPy/examples/``
when the container is running.

Jupyter notebook servers running from within the
container can be accessed after invoking them by issuing:

    $ cd /opt/LFPy/examples/
    $ jupyter-notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port=5000 --no-browser --allow-root


and opening the resulting URL in a browser on the host computer, similar to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/?token=dcf8f859f859740fc858c568bdd5b015e0cf15bfc2c5b0c1


HTML Documentation
------------------

To generate the html documentation also hosted at https://lfpy.rtfd.io using Sphinx,
issue from the LFPy source code directory:

    $ cd doc
    $ make html


The main html file is in ``_build/html/index.html``.
m2r2, Numpydoc and the Sphinx ReadTheDocs theme may be needed:

    $ pip install m2r2 --user
    $ pip install numpydoc --user
    $ pip install sphinx-rtd-theme --user


Physical units in LFPy
----------------------

Physical units follow the NEURON conventions found [here](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/units/unitchart.html).
The units in LFPy for given quantities are:

| Quantity                   | Symbol    | Unit      |
|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Spatial dimensions         | x,y,z,d   | [μm]      |
| Potential                  | v, Phi, Φ | [mV]      |
| Reversal potential         | E         | [mV]      |
| Current                    | i         | [nA]      |
| Membrane capacitance       | c_m       | [μF/cm2]  |
| Conductance                | g         | [S/cm2]   |
| Synaptic conductance       | g         | [µS]      |
| Extracellular conductivity | sigma, σ  | [S/m]     |
| Current dipole moment      | P         | [nA µm]   |
| Magnetic field             | H         | [nA/µm]   |
| Magnetic permeability      | µ, mu     | [T m/A]   |
| Current Source Density     | CSD       | [nA/µm3]  |  

Note: resistance, conductance and capacitance are usually specific values, i.e per membrane area (lowercase r_m, g, c_m)
Depending on the mechanism files, some may use different units altogether, but this should be taken care of internally by NEURON.
